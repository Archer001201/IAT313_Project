The day started on a sour note with Vincent's mother scolding him, leaving him disheartened, but his father's comforting words offered solace and a reminder of the support at home.\nThe hours Vincent and Yvonne spent together in the library not only solidified their study habits but also their emotional connection, reinforcing a partnership that extended beyond academics.\nAs the fourth phase concluded, the days were marked by personal growth and the deepening of relationships. Each encounter, whether with family, friends, or classmates, became a stepping stone towards not only academic readiness but also the cultivation of enduring friendships.",
