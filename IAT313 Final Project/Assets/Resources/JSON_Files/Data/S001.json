Simultaneously, she demonstrated a proactive attitude towards her studies, actively seeking Vincent's help on academic matters. This supportive atmosphere not only deepened the friendship between the two but also created a positive learning space for them to face academic challenges together. This second scenario marked a beneficial beginning for the two students to collaborate and grow together in the new semester.",
